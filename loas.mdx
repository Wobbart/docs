## ‚ùì What are LOAs (Leave Of Absences)?

LOAs allow your staff members to go on a break when they are not up to fufilling their duties! This is helpful in situations where staff members can't access their device or are going through any personal life problems.

Melonly has a robust leave of absence feature that allows staff to request leave of absences and administrators to approve them. Melonly can automatically end leave of absences when they end, apply roles in Discord, have cooldowns between submissions, and more. All settings for leave of absences can be set in the Leave of Absences tab of your server's dashboard.


## How do I request an LOA?

A leave of absence can be requested by going to the server's moderator panel and clicking Manage Leave of Absence. Here, you can submit a leave of absence request. After submitting the form, the request must be reviewed by server administrators.

## Reviewing leave of absences

Leave of absences can be reviewed in the Leave of Absences tab of your server's dashboard. If there are any pending requests, there will be an Awaiting Review section. Click the request, review the content, and click Approve or Deny.

## LOA Configuration

Melonly can automatically give and remove a role for staff members on leave of absence. To set this up, go to the **Discord Integration** tab of your server dashboard and set the  **Leave of Absence Role** setting. 

To setup this feature, you must link the Discord server by following the discord integration section. 

To log leave of absence events in a discord channel, go to the Discord Integration tab of your server dashboard and set the **Leave of Absence Channel** setting.
