## üìñ Applications

The Applications plugin is a streamlined way of easily creating forms/applications for any purpose. It is packed full of configurations - the ability to give roles upon being accepted, able to join a melonly server directly, ability to "stage" applications, comment on them and so much more!

## ‚ùì So why should I use Melonly applications instead of Google forms?

Google forms is a popular option for most ER:LC Private Servers, however, it was not designed towards them. For example input options are quite limited; users have to manually write down their information such as discord name and Roblox name. This is very slow for everyone and is not very user-friendly - this is what makes Melonly Applications different. With Melonly you can automatically collect their discord and Roblox information when they submit the application.

## That sounds very cool, can it get any better?

Melonly applications are designed with built in requirements, for example you can require people to have a discord role, be in your server for a certain amount of time or not exceed an amount of modlogs in your server.



##  üíº Creating an Application

To create an application first head to the application page on the dashboard. There you can create an application and give it a name - don't worry this can be changed later.

Next let's add some questions! Press the plus icon in the center of the screen to add a question. Questions are the base of any good application which is why we offer multiple types:

- Short Text (for basic question responses)
- Long Text (Where you intend the responder to write paragraphs of information.
- Number (Self Explanatory)
- Multiple Choice (Select 1 out of many prewritten options)
- Checkbox (Select multiple out of many prewritten options)
- Drop-down (Same as multi choice but it's a drop-down instead of a list)
- Linear Scale (Select option on scale, eg "Rate this server from 1-5")
- Date (Day on a calendar)
- Time (Time in a day)
